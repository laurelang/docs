# Article

Laurelang documentation consists of articles.

Each article is divided into 3 sections which are:

* Name
* Preambula
* Contents

To split them following separator is written:

```
*---*
```

Name of the article file has `.article` extension.

Double underscore `__` is needed to declare nested articles which are reachable at `/wiki/section/topic` for `section__topic.article`.

# Name section

Just name.

May have second line with tags `, ` separated.

# Preambula section

Short, clear information.

# Contents section

Main headers (`#`) will appear in `Contents` section right after the preambula.
